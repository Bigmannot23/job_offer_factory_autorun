Hi CI&T Hiring Team,

I hope you're doing well. I recently came across the Senior Software Architect, Python and Java role at CI&T. I'm a self-taught Python engineer who has built production-ready APIs and integrated AI models into real-world products. My Lexvion project demonstrates building a secure, scalable microservice architecture with fast data processing and strong compliance features. I believe my background in Python, microservices and AI/automation aligns well with your requirements. I'd love to discuss how I can contribute to your team.

Best regards,
AI Mastermind
