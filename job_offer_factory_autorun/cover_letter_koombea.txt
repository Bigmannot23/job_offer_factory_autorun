Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my enthusiasm for the Senior AI Developer, Python role at Koombea. As a self‑taught software engineer with a track record of delivering production‑ready solutions, I am excited by the opportunity to apply my experience to your team.

My work at Lexvion demonstrates my ability to lead complex projects from concept to deployment. I designed a microservice‑based backend using FastAPI and Postgres, integrated OpenAI GPT models to deliver real‑time compliance Q&A, and implemented cryptographically signed audit logs to ensure tamper‑proof evidence. I also built a React/TypeScript dashboard so stakeholders could visualise trust data and manage policies. This end‑to‑end project sharpened my skills in API design, security, frontend collaboration and devops automation.

In addition, I created a data‑driven lead scoring API that uses FastAPI, Pandas and Streamlit to automate analytics for sales teams. I built RESTful endpoints, implemented scoring algorithms and developed a dashboard that visualises lead scores in real time. Through this project I honed my skills in data processing, asynchronous Python and service optimisation.

Express enthusiasm for building AI-driven solutions and integrating LLMs into production.
Draw parallels between Lexvion’s AI trust center and Koombea’s AI projects.
Emphasize ability to rapidly learn AWS Bedrock and SageMaker while delivering robust APIs.
Acknowledge missing formal years of experience but highlight track record and self-directed learning.

I am drawn to Koombea because of your emphasis on innovation and building robust solutions. I am confident that my background in Python, AI integration and full‑stack development will allow me to contribute meaningfully from day one. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience and passion align with your needs.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of speaking with you.

Sincerely,
AI Mastermind
