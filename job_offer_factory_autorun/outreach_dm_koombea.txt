Hi Koombea Hiring Team,

I hope you're doing well. I recently came across the Senior AI Developer, Python role at Koombea. I'm a self-taught Python engineer who has built production-ready APIs and integrated AI models into real-world products. Check out my Lexvion project where I integrate GPT models with FastAPI and AWS to deliver real-time compliance Q&A and secure audit logs. I believe my background in Python, microservices and AI/automation aligns well with your requirements. I'd love to discuss how I can contribute to your team.

Best regards,
AI Mastermind
