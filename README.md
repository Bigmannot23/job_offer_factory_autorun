# Job Offer Factory 🏭

🚀 **Elevator pitch:** Turn job descriptions into tailored applications on autopilot. The Job Offer Factory parses job postings, scores fit, generates custom resumes and cover letters and logs each application so you can apply to more roles with less effort.

### Part of the Operator Meta Portfolio:

### Proof‑of‑ROI
- **99% automation:** The pipeline automated almost all manual steps in the job‑search process【636159766478501†L8-L16】.
- **Time saved:** Cut preparation and application time from hours to minutes【636159766478501†L8-L16】.
- **Increased throughput:** Apply to more targeted roles by scoring fit before you spend time customizing.

### What it does
- **Job description parsing:** Extracts key requirements, responsibilities and keywords【574582600150117†L7-L21】.
- **Fit scoring:** Uses heuristics or models to score how well your profile matches a posting【574582600150117†L7-L21】.
- **Automated document generation:** Crafts tailored resumes and cover letters using templates and dynamic content【510983817102102†L11-L26】.
- **Application logging & dashboard:** Records applications and statuses for later analysis; integrates with the Operator Metrics Dashboard.
- **Modular pipeline:** Each stage can be run independently or replaced with custom logic.

### Why it matters
Searching for a job is laborious. Automating repetitive tasks lets operators focus on networking and preparing for interviews. This project demonstrates how AI and automation create leverage for job seekers and can be repurposed for sales or other domains.

### Quickstart
1. Clone this repo and install dependencies.
2. Gather a set of job postings (CSV, JSON or scraped).
3. Run the pipeline: parse postings, score fit, generate documents.
4. Review and send applications; check the generated dashboard for progress.
5. See `polished_README.md` and `operator_guide.md` for details.

### Operator principles
Automation first (bot does the work), modularity (each stage is replaceable), operator focus (helps job seekers directly) and compounding learning (fits into the wider portfolio and informs the metrics dashboard).
